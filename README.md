# UpStarMusic

Application built as part of Stephen Grider's MongoDB course on Udemy. This app is built with React + Electron and MongoDB. It geneates fake artists for the user to filter through using:

- Name
- Age
- Years Active

It also allows sorting by:
- Name
- Age
- Number of Albums released

# Assigned Task

The front end was pre generated. My job was to create the MongoDB models and the queries.
